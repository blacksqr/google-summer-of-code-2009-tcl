<p>The Tcl/Tk community includes anybody who uses Tcl/Tk, is interested in Tcl/Tk, or just wants to be in the club! Tcl/Tk is used by a wide range of governmental, commercial and educational institutions around the globe. Many well-known and well-regarded systems have either been developed in Tcl/Tk or are using Tcl/Tk as an embedded language (e.g. Expect, AOLserver, DejaGnu, Metakit, Starkit and SQLite). We communicate through IRC (see below), an active development list (see below) and a wiki (<a href='http://wiki.tcl.tk'>http://wiki.tcl.tk</a>). The Eighth European Tcl/Tk Users Meeting will be held in June, and September we will be holding our sixteenth annual Tcl/Tk conference in the USA.</p>
